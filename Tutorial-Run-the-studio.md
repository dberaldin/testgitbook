# Run the Studio

In the event that you're more comfortable interacting with database systems through a graphical interface, you can accomplish most common database tasks with the web interface OrientDB Studio.

## Connecting to Studio

By default, there are no additional steps that you need to take to start OrientDB Studio. When you launch the Server, whether through the start-up script `server.sh` or as a system daemon, the Studio web interface opens automatically with it.

<pre>
$ <code class="lang-sh userinput">firefox http://localhost:2480</code>
</pre>

From here you can create a new database, connect to or drop an existing database, import a public database and navigate to the Server management interface.
