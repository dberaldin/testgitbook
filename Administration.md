_____

OrientDB has a number of tools to make administration of the database easier. There is the [console](Tutorial-Run-the-console.md), which allows you to run a large number of [commands](Console-Commands.md).

There is also the [OrientDB Studio](Home-page.md), which allows you to run queries and visually look at the graph.

OrientDB also offers several tools for the [import and export of data](Export-and-Import.md), [logging](Logging.md) and [trouble shooting](Troubleshooting.md), along with [ETL tools](ETL-Introduction.md). 

All of OrientDB's administration facilities are aimed to make your usage of OrientDB as simple and as easy as possible.
