# Enterprise Edition

This is the main guide on using <b>OrientDB Enterprise Edition</b>. For more information look at [OrientDB Enterprise Edition](http://orientdb.com/enterprise.htm).

Enterprise Edition is in Beta stage, ask for a Trial by writing to: info@orientdb.com.

OrientDB Enterprise Edition is composed by 2 modules:
- Enterprise **Agent**
- Enterprise **Workbench**

## OrientDB Enterprise Agent
The Agent contains the license generated by Orient Technologies. If you're a client you already own Agent jar files to install. If you don't have them or you want to try Enterprise Edition write to: info@orientdb.com.

The Agent contains the [Profiler](Profiler.md) component to get monitored by Workbench.

### Installation
In order to enable Enterprise feature, copy the provided **agent-*.jar** file under the OrientDB Server "plugins" directory of each server. The plugin will be hot loaded by the server after few seconds (look at the server's output). In case the plugin is not loaded restart the OrientDB Server.

Once installed, the Agent Plugin displays the license information. Example:

    2013-12-18 16:52:43:206 INFO Installing dynamic plugin 'agent-1.6.2.jar'...

_NOTE: OrientDB Enterprise Plugin and OrientDB Server must be of the same main version. Workbench 1.7.x works against all Agents 2.0.x. If you don't have the right version please write to the Orient Technologies: info@orientdb.com._

## OrientDB Enterprise Workbench

_NOTE: OrientDB Workbench runs as separate application. In order to avoid slow down of OrientDB Servers, it's a best practice to run Workbench on a separate server._

    To open the Web Console open your browser to the URL: http://localhost:2491 and use 'admin' as user and password to log in, unless you already changed it.

Now point your browser to the local server's IP address, port 2491, example: **http://localhost:2491**. This is the login page. Use the default credentials as user "admin" and password "admin" (you can change it once logged in).
